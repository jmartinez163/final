          <h2>Baseball</h2>
          <p> Baseball is one of my favorite sports, many people feel the same way as its known as "America's past time".
          This sport is played between two teams on a diamond shaped field. There are 9 innings. Each inning consists
          of two halves the "top" and "bottom" inning. The home teams pay defense in the top of every inning, and offense
          in the bottom half of the inning. The objective of the game is to score as many runs as possible. A run is
          scored when a player in the offense hits the baseball with a bat safely which allows him to reach base and
          if player successfully touches all four bases before the offense gets three outs a run is scored. Outs are made when
          player on offense strikes out, flys out, or grounds out.  Major League Baseball is the most prestige baseball
          league in the world. Every summer teams compete sharing the ultimate goal: to win the World Series.

            <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>Basketball the only sport in this lecture that isn't played on a field, it is played on a wooden floor rectangular
            basketball court. The objective of this sport is to dribble the basketball to your opponents basket and score
            the ball inside of the hoop. This game is played between two teams of five players and it lasts 4-15 minute
            quarters. An arc is painted on the floor around the basket, if player shoots ball from within the arc, team
            will score 2 points, but if ball is scored from outside of arc, team will get 3 points. Basketball was invented
            in 1891 by James Naismith, a Canadian Physical education instructor who wanted to make a sport that was less
            injury prone than football. At the end of every season, the team who are crowned champions are awarded the
